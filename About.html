            My name is ELKHEDAR Omaima. I’m an Iot and data Science engineering and big intrested in Web Developpement who takes solo trips around the world. So far, I have been to many places and have many more trips planned. Not to mention, I’ll travel in my own backyard  whenever possible.
            As a person, exploring is what I do best. Did I mention I’m terrified of flying? I might have picked the wrong hobby! But I’m living proof that you can follow your dreams even if they happen to scare you. <br> <br>
            It’s obvious to everyone who meets me that I love traveling. The idea of travel, packing my bags and disappearing to someplace new, lives inside the brain allllll the time. For example, whenever I meet someone for the first time or even encounter an old friend, I instantly want to talk about my upcoming trips, ask about their own adventures, share embarrassing and funny travel stories, and swap bucket list ideas. <br> <br>
            And yeah, I’ll admit it. I’m probably a little annoying to my non-traveling friends and acquaintances, but I can’t help myself. My “wanderlusty” passion seeps through my pores, out of my control. Passion is a good thing, I guess? <br> <br>
            A few years ago I wrote about 29 ways travel changes you into a more spontaneous, well-rounded, and grateful person. Although I still stand by the ideas in that post, I still felt inspired to write an entire essay explaining why I love traveling so much. <br> <br>
            Exploring the world costs time and money (not to mention, boarding planes stresses me to the max!) so the trade-offs need to be worth it, right? <br> <br> <br> <br><br> <br>
