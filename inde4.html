        <h2 style=" font-size: 30px; text-align: center; margin-bottom: 16px;"> Paradise valley, A Wonderful Place to visit </h2>
        <div id="paragraph">
            <p >
                At approximately 20 kilometers north of Agadir, an altitude of 1600 meters at the High Atlas Mountains, located one of the most picturesque places in Morocco, the Paradise Valley.  A huge and deep valley is buried in the greenery of palm groves and orchards. The flowing river in the Paradise Valley is a high-water river originating high in the mountains. <br>
                The Paradise Valley is also known as the “honey route “, as here they produce a large amount of honey of different types: lavender, orange, lemon, cactus, which differ not only in excellent taste, but also in invaluable health benefits. <br> <br>
                Near the valley there is a waterfall. The waterfall has an unusual white color, as it flows down the limestone. The waterfall falls into the lake, on the banks of which grow olive trees. In the heart of the paradise valley is the town of Imouzzer.  Located in a palm grove, it will be to the taste of all lovers of nature and peace. <br>
                In the village of Imouzzer every Thursday, a bazaar is unfolding, selling the local delicacy – honey. Also in late July or early August, there is a five-day honey fair (mousse).
                Long time ago, these lands were inhabited by the Berbers, engaged in terraced farming on the slopes of the mountains. In the 70’s, the territory of the Paradise Valley was chosen by the hippies, wishing to enjoy solitude and pristine nature. <br><br>
                There are several legends about the name of this magical place. While legend has it that Jimi Hendrix gave his name to the Paradise Valley in the 1960s, there is yet another story: In the 1960s, a sick woman and her husband were said to have retreated to the Paradise Valley – with hope for quick life recovery. The woman recovered so unexpectedly fast that since that day the valley bears its paradisical name!
                The Paradise Valley is the perfect location for long hikes off the Moroccan waves. It goes through thousands of palm trees, shrubs and bushes. A small river with radiant turquoise blue water leads into the valley and flows into a bathing area with breathtaking waterfalls, which invite you to cool down as well as to cliff jumping. <br>
                The air here is warmed by sunlight and filled with the scents of flowering trees. In such silence you can hear the murmur of running water, the singing of birds, the buzzing of bees and the quiet rustle of leaves, and feel the coldness of the river and the shade from the trees give life-giving coolness during a debilitating heat.
