            Want to take a breath of clean air, far from the hustle and bustle of big cities? Aguelmam Azegza is the right place for you. 
            Located in the heart of the Middle Atlas, and 30km from Khenifra, "the blue lake" is a little paradise on earth. Surrounded by cedar mountains, the site is a great place for family walks. 
            In the absence of cafes, restaurants and other small shops, residents have improvised "restaurateurs". They offer tea, tagines and other regional specialties, in the shade of tents. <br> <br> An offer still insufficient to meet the expectations of visitors. 
            Another downside is access to the lake. The region finds itself penalized by the lack of basic infrastructure. The road to the site is badly damaged. It takes 45 minutes by car to be able to enjoy this haven of freshness.
